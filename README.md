You need to create a `logins.json` file in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following information:

```json
[
  {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "admin"
  },
  {
    "username": "user",
    "password": "user"
  }
]
```

`database.db` file will create automatically when you run the project.
